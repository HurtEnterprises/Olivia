     from the user to read and share every type of object for which the application may require access.
     
     The request is performed asynchronously and its completion will be executed on an arbitrary background
     queue after the user has responded.  If the user has already chosen whether to grant the application
     access to all of the types provided, then the completion will be called without prompting the user.
     The success parameter of the completion indicates whether prompting the user, if necessary, completed
     successfully and was not cancelled by the user.  It does NOT indicate whether the application was
     granted authorization.

     given quantity type or the default unit for that type in the current locale of the device. To access the
